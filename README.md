# Capstone Project: Event Planner 
## Service Layer

This repository contains the service layer design documents for my capstone project.
The purpose of the project is to create an event planning and inventory tracking system. It allows the user to add inventory, receipts, and number of people to help keep track of the things for a current event and help plan future events.
